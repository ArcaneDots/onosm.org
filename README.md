# OnOSM

An easy way to get a business on to OpenStreetMap.

## Language

The application text defaults to being displayed in British English. Mainly because that is the "official" lanaguage of OpenStreetMaps project. Alternate translations are also availble and displayed in the drop-down at the top of the page. Selecting one will update the active translation.

## Description

OnOSM helps business owners provide structured data about their shop. The result is written to an anonymous [OpenStreetMap Note](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes). See [recently created notes](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/?query=submitted%20note%20from%20a%20business).
